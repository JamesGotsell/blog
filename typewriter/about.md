Hi I'm James

I’m a recent Graduate of the Web development immersive at General Assembly, It was a 12 week development bootcamp in Shoreditch.
I’m person who loves to use code with a dash of creativity to make cool things, who wants to keep learning and keep building cool things. 

While working in Spain as an English teacher, I developed a passion for code. I had an idea and wasn’t able to implement it, so I went out a bought myself a book on html and css, the working through the book my eyes were opened with what you can do with a bit of creativity and knowledge. 
Fast forward a few years, I’ve finished the Web development immersive at General Assembly and I’ve loved the every minute of it. The amount of information I’ve had to learn over the three months has given me the hunger to continue learning to progress as a developer. 

I want to continue to learn throughout my career, I love to join a passionate team of developers that would support my personal and professional development. I’m sure the journey to be an awesome web developer will be stressful but ultimately fun with a good bunch of people around you.
