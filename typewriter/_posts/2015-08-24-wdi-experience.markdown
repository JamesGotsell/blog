After the madness of 12 weeks of 9-5 pure coding I was drained but up beat, 
I knew that I entered an industry that won't allow me to sit on my arse. 
WDi installed in me the importance of keep learning to keep relevant as an developer.  
In spare time i've trying to learn php/angular and ionic plus rehashing all the stuff I learned   
during the WDi. 

Fun Fact - I added over a million lines of code to github during the 12 weeks (madness)
